### :cat: Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Scott!

I'm Scott, a current undergraduate computer science specialist student at the University of Toronto.

I'm interested in all kinds of stuff in computer science, especially software and game development. Also, I'm a note-taking fanatic: I love all kinds of note-taking software like Obsidian, Notion, Typora, and so forth.

I made some Minecraft mods and Minecraft is my favorite game!

I love cats and dogs! I have a dog with 50% German Shepherd and 50% Belgian Malinois. :> She's really cute ... and big!
